## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a simulation-based investigation into the **Binomial distribution** using MATLAB, analyzing how well **Normal** and **Poisson** distributions approximate it under various conditions.

It includes:
- A **detailed report** in PDF format.
- A well-commented **MATLAB code**.
- Graphical analysis for different values of `n` and `p`.
- Explanation of conditions under which different approximations are valid.

## 📄 Contents

- `report.pdf` – Full academic report with background theory, approximation rules, and test results.
- `binomial_simulation.m` – MATLAB script that:
  - Calculates binomial probabilities.
  - Compares with Poisson and Gaussian approximations.
  - Visualizes probability mass functions and probability density functions.

## 🔬 Key Concepts

- **Binomial Distribution**  
  Models the number of successes in `n` independent Bernoulli trials.

- **Poisson Approximation**  
  Effective when `n` is large and `p` is small such that `np ≤ 2`.

- **Normal Approximation**  
  Effective when both `np ≥ 5` and `nq ≥ 5`.
